## About the project

The product recommendation engine is collaborative and utilizes data from an e-commerce store to suggest similar products based on the user's selection. Community detection using Louvain clustering is employed to identify related products. The user interface is created using Flask API, and the detected communities are analyzed through Gephi visualizations.

In essence, a product recommendation engine is a software that analyzes user actions on e-commerce websites to suggest products that may interest them. This can lead to improved customer experience and increased sales for the e-commerce website. By identifying products that are frequently purchased together, community detection can facilitate the creation of a product recommendation engine. User purchase patterns are utilized to form communities for this purpose.
